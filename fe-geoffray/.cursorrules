# React Native Expo TypeScript Rules

## Project Overview
This is a React Native Expo project using Expo Router for navigation, TypeScript for type safety, and modern React Native development practices.

## React Native Expo Best Practices
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Utilize Expo SDK features and APIs extensively
- Implement proper navigation using Expo Router (file-based routing)
- Use Expo's asset system for images, fonts, and other static resources
- Implement proper error handling and crash reporting with Expo
- Utilize Expo's push notification system
- Use Expo's secure store for sensitive data storage
- Implement proper offline support and data persistence
- Follow React Native performance best practices
- Use Expo's OTA updates for quick deployments

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Always use TypeScript for type safety
- Define proper interfaces and types for all data structures
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Implement proper typing for API responses and requests
- Use generics where appropriate for reusable components
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing or `unknown` instead

## Folder Structure
```

## Development Guidelines

### Component Development
- Use functional components with hooks exclusively
- Implement proper component composition and reusability
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when needed
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Implement proper error boundaries

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state management
- Implement custom hooks for complex state logic
- Use AsyncStorage or Expo SecureStore for persistence
- Consider using React Query/TanStack Query for server state

### Navigation
- Use Expo Router for file-based navigation
- Implement proper navigation types
- Use navigation guards for protected routes
- Handle deep linking appropriately
- Implement proper navigation state management

### Styling
- Use StyleSheet.create() for performance
- Implement responsive design principles
- Use Expo's vector icons (@expo/vector-icons)
- Consider using design system or component libraries
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Implement proper dark mode support

### API Integration
- Centralize API configuration and endpoints
- Use proper error handling and retry logic
- Implement proper loading states
- Use TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- Handle network connectivity issues
- Implement proper request/response interceptors

### Performance Optimization
- Use React.memo(), useMemo(), and useCallback() appropriately
- Implement proper image optimization
- Use FlatList for large lists
- Implement proper bundle splitting
- Use Expo's performance monitoring tools
- Optimize bundle size and startup time

### Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Implement component testing with React Native Testing Library
- Use Jest for testing framework
- Mock external dependencies properly
- Test across different platforms (iOS, Android, Web)

### Security
- Use Expo SecureStore for sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication flows
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Follow React Native security best practices

### Internationalization
- Use i18next with react-i18next for translations
- Implement proper locale handling
- Support RTL languages if needed
- Use Expo's localization utilities

### Platform-Specific Code
- Use Platform.select() for platform-specific logic
- Implement proper cross-platform storage utilities
- Handle platform-specific navigation patterns
- Use platform-specific styling when necessary

## Code Quality
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Write self-documenting code with proper comments
- Implement proper error logging and crash reporting
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Review code before merging

## Development Workflow
- Use Expo development build for testing
- Implement proper environment configuration
- Use EAS Build for production builds
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
- Use Expo's development tools and debugger
- Test on both iOS and Android devices regularly
